# Week-2-GMNO - Art of Code 

# Team rules
- Pair swapping after each task/issue is completed
- each pair should make sure they understand what each pair is doing 

# Design 
- we should use bem methodology
- cards will expand/zoom in when hovered over

# How it works:
- User will be asked how much they want to be inspired
- Depending on answer we will display images with quotes within that ratings range
- Results will be displayed in card-form => which include art images and quotes beneath them

# Bonus


# Extra-Bonus
- Use drag and drop API to effectively move the cards that the user likes into a different folder/page
