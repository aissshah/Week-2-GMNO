# Week-2-GMNO - Art of Code 
Our project this week is to build an app that queries at least two APIs and uses the results to update the DOM. There should be a way for the user to search, filter, sort or otherwise affect what is displayed.

What you choose to build and how you choose to display the data is entirely up to you!

## User Stories
A user story is a description of one or more features of a piece of software.

## Core Stories
As a user, I want to:

- See an interesting mashup of different data

- Input information to change the displayed result

- View the app on all of my devices

- Since your app will be unique you will need to create your own user stories for more specific features.

## Stretch stories
- As an impatient user, I want to see some indication that data is loading

- As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong

## Acceptance Criteria
- Query at least two APIs using fetch

- Dynamic content generated with JS

- A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme

- A responsive, mobile-first design

- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible

- Try not to push API keys up to GitHub (since anyone can see them there)

## Planning
- During the planning phase we suggest you spend time on:

- Exploring APIs you are interested in working with

- Considering your user journey

- Deciding what you need to build for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and splitting up the tasks

## Choosing your APIs
Things to check before you start:
- Does it support CORS (cross-origin requests)?

- Is there a high enough rate limit?

- Is a free API key available?

- Are you able to use the API without user authentication (oAuth)?

- Is good documentation available?


## Team rules
- Pair swapping after each task/issue is completed
- each pair should make sure they understand what each pair is doing 

## Design 
- we should use bem methodology
- cards will expand/zoom in when hovered over

## How it works:
- User will be asked how much they want to be inspired
- Depending on answer we will display images with quotes within that ratings range
- Results will be displayed in card-form => which include art images and quotes beneath them

## Bonus
- Use drag and drop API to effectively move the cards that the user likes into a different folder/page
